Title: StackLinkedList - Linear Single Linked List Implementation of Stack in C++

Description:
StackLinkedList is a C++ implementation of a stack data structure using a linear single linked list. This repository provides a flexible and efficient stack implementation, offering essential stack operations and demonstrating the use of a linked list as the underlying data structure.

Key Features:

Linked List-Based Stack: StackLinkedList utilizes a linear single linked list to store and manage stack elements, providing dynamic memory allocation and deallocation as elements are pushed and popped.

Essential Stack Operations: The implementation includes fundamental stack operations, such as push (to add elements to the top of the stack), pop (to remove elements from the top), and peek (to access the top element without modifying the stack).

Efficient Memory Management: StackLinkedList optimizes memory usage by dynamically allocating memory for nodes as new elements are pushed and deallocating memory when elements are popped, ensuring efficient memory utilization.

Error Handling: The implementation incorporates error handling mechanisms to handle potential errors, such as stack underflow (when trying to pop from an empty stack) or memory allocation failures.

Customizability and Extendability: StackLinkedList serves as a foundation for further customization and extension. You can easily modify the implementation or build upon it to incorporate additional functionalities specific to your project requirements.

This StackLinkedList repository is a valuable resource for understanding the stack data structure and learning about the implementation of a stack using a linked list. Whether you're a student learning data structures or a developer looking to integrate stack functionality into your projects, StackLinkedList offers an intuitive and efficient solution.

Explore the implementation, leverage the power of a linear single linked list as the underlying structure, and enhance your understanding of stack operations in C++.
